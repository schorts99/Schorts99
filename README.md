# Hi, I'm Jorge Castillo üëã

Senior Full-Stack Engineer | Architectural Focus

Senior Full-Stack Engineer with 8+ years of hands-on experience designing, scaling, and leading the development of robust web and mobile applications. My expertise is rooted in modern stacks, primarily Ruby on Rails, Next.js, React, and TypeScript.

I focus on architectural integrity, leveraging patterns like Event-Driven Architecture (RabbitMQ) and Ports and Adapters to build highly maintainable and resilient systems. I thrive on solving complex, high-scale security and performance issues.

## üöÄ Architectural & Open-Source Contributions

I enjoy creating internal tools and architectural assets that increase organizational efficiency and code safety:

### Shared Kernel

Engineered and published a framework-agnostic npm package ([@schorts/shared-kernel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@schorts/shared-kernel)) using TypeScript to provide core, type-safe abstractions for domain modeling, authentication, and HTTP integration.

Guarantees consistency and accelerates development across multiple distinct application projects.
